# Hijithan's Website

My portfolio website is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the Three.js library for 3D graphics. It showcases my skills and projects through interactive and visually engaging elements, providing a modern and dynamic user experience.\
You can access the website [here](https://xlmt09.github.io/portfolio/).
